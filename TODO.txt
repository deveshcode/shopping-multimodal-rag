TODO List 

Data Pipeline





Search functionality can be improved
Text embeddings could be used alongside Text
Filtering of metadata could be data
Hybrid search could be implemented
Florence model could also be used

Verify search by image functionality
Top N results functionality is not included
Why are csv files needed if the 

Langchain / llama index could be used
Streamlit-chat functionality could be integrated
streamlit lottie and streamlit extra could be used 
Adding functionality of a follow up query - that 50$ is too much show me a cheaper option

Complementary - image - shorts - suggest tshirts - GPT-4o 
Streamlit app should be streamlti commands
Deploy google cloud 
Dockerize and deploy 
For fastapi using langchain / llama index for api calling
